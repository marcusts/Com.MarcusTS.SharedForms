# Shared Forms: Simpler, Better Xamarin.Forms Apps

Xamarin can be difficult to manage for an IT staff because it requires ***behavioral*** thinking vs. web-like ***scripting***.  This library provides tons of helpful Forms components and logic to make your life easier:

- Validations, including behaviors
- Custom input controls such as check boxes, editable entries, etc. -- all validation-ready
- An image label button that replaces all existing buttons with a much more powerful, stylable paradigm
- "State machine" style navigation that replaces tired, old menu bars and back stacks.
- Binding utilities
- Many methods to allow quick creation of UI elements such as grids
- Dozens of utilities to handle the Xamarin.Forms side of things *(similar to what [Shared Utils](https://github.com/marcusts/Com.MarcusTS.SharedUtils) does for C#)*
- A scalable UI that auto-adjusts for any device on-the-fly
- View mode bases and examples to make these a snap

Shared Forms is a sub-set of a comprehensive Xamarin.Forms code base.  See the new [Xamarin Forms Support](https://github.com/marcusts/Com.MarcusTS.ResponsiveTasks.XamFormsSupport) library for more details.  That project references this one.

Don't worry about the vast number of offerings.  The Visual Studio Linker only includes what you ***actually use***!
